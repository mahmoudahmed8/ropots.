            A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions
            automatically. Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within.
            Robots may be constructed on the lines of human form, but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with
            no regard to their aesthetics.
            Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative
            Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, 
            patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics
            MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot 
            may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming 
            decade,with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers

         <span style="font-size: large;"> branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots,as well as computer
         systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated 
         machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in 
         appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired 
         robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.
         From the time of ancient civilization, there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and even automata
         resembling humans and other animals, designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through the
         Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and wireless 
         remote-control.</span>
